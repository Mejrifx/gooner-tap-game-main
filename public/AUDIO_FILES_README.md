# Custom Audio Files for Tap Sounds

## Audio Files Added:
- `turtle-sound-1.mp3` - Sound for first tap/frame (Gooner image frame 1) ✅
- `turtle-sound-2.mp3` - Sound for second tap/frame (Gooner image frame 2) ✅

## File Requirements:
- Format: MP3 (for best browser compatibility)
- Size: Recommended under 1-2MB each
- Quality: Good enough for game sound effects

## Implementation:
- Frame 0 (first tap) plays `turtle-sound-1.mp3`
- Frame 1 (second tap) plays `turtle-sound-2.mp3`
- Sounds loop as user continues tapping
- Volume is set to 50% but can be adjusted

## Status:
✅ Audio files added successfully!
✅ System configured to use turtle sounds
✅ Ready to play on tap

Current implementation uses the Audio Web API for playback.
